This is a full-stack project that uses the Rijksmuseumâ€™s API to fetch their collection. The purpose of this app is to explore the museum's collection, which includes over 10,000 objects, and gain a better understanding of what objects are in the collection. When users are logged in, they can create a virtual exhibition by liking objects in the main search and present their exhibition with an introductory blurb. Other users are able to leave comments on their experience with the virtual exhibition.
